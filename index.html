				<h1>UX/UI</h1>
				<h3>Why is UX/UI important in site design?</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-1">
				<p class="text-justify">To understand the importance of User Experience <b>(UX)</b> and User Interface <b>(UI)</b> design you must first understand that UX and UI are broad terms that encompass the overall user involvement while visiting a site. The primary goal of any business is to increase growth and sales of the business. A seamless user experience of your site is key to increases in both areas.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">UX development is the process of improving users overall experience when they interact with a website or application and maximizing customer satisfaction. Keeping customers in mind when developing the website wireframing guides the consumer through the website in a logical and structured flow. This flow moves the user toward the target goal of purchasing products or services.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">UI development, on the other hand, is the process of improving the interactions and presentation of a website or application. It focuses on the looks and interactions with the user and is responsive to user input. This includes the screen, buttons, navigation and other visual elements of a website.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">With users having expansive choices in products and services, the objective it to grab the attention of the user in a short amount of time. First impressions are crucial, and last long. UX/UI design can make of break this impression and either drive customers toward you or away from you.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">Core components of great UX/UI design are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Usability: Is it easy to use?</li>
					<li>Visual Design: What does it look like?</li>
					<li>Wireframing: How does the prototype look?</li>
					<li>Interaction Design: How do users engage with it?</li>
					<li>Information Architecture: Does the structure/flow make sense?</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="text-justify">Since UX and UI development largely focus on the users' satisfaction and pleasure in website use, it plays a crucial role in business success. The user satisfaction is essential in building the brand, value and reputation of the business. UX and UI design services from LawDesign can build these key elements for your law firm's success. Give us the opportunity, during your <a href="#contact_us"><b >FREE</b></a> consultation to review your current site, and show you how we can improve user engagement, loyalty and satisfaction. </p>

							<h3>Content Issues & Actions</h3>
							<p>Users of websites most often decide to leave a website due to time. As you can see above the top three reasons for leaving a site are images not loading, the site takes to long to load or the content was to long. These three are all time related meaning that if a site loads quickly, has content that is not overbearing, and images do not take a long time to load customers and users will be more likely to stay on your site to purchase products and services.</p>
							<p>The next three factors that affect user experience are UI related. Content layout, interactions (buttons and links not working), and display based on device used are also manageable through smart UI design. Ensuring all features and functions work is important to user and will keep users coming back to your site. <b>LawDesign's</b> highly skilled team of UX/UI designers are trained to identify and correct the top issues related to the speed at which your site operates for the user, as well as having a logical flow of content. We ensure that the user is able to navigate quickly, and that all features and functions work, <i>every time.</i></br></br><a href="#contact_us">Click <b>HERE</b> to speak with a consultant now.</a></p>

							<h3>Content Sources & Consumption</h3>
							<p>There is no denying that across the the three most recent generations, online interaction via search engines is the top way that users consume data with Baby Boomers preferring television over online search engines. Television and social media sites are the second and third place sources for data and influence younger generations more than the older generations.</p>
							<p>When <b>LawDesign</b> works with you to develop your website, we also review your social media needs during the initial consultation. Our consultants are trained to review your businesses entire footprint from search engine placement to social media, we will review and make suggestions based on your current footprint and offer you solutions that you are comfortable with. We offer packages from review and suggestions to a full website overhaul and social media campaign.</br></br><a href="#contact_us">Click <b>HERE</b> to speak with a consultant now.</a></p>

							<h3>Design Values & Importance</h3>
							<p>Consumers of data place high importance on the content viewing experience. Users want content that is well written, hold their attention, displays in a proper format for the device they are using (from laptop to mobile formatting) and on overall design that guides them through the content. These factors are all related to UX/UI development, ensuring that users can get the content they need without obstructive ads, content or pop-ups that interfere with the users overall site satisfaction. This is true both in the personal and professional realm of data consumption.</p>
							<p>At <b>LawDesign</b>, we concentrate on the total user experience. We test our designs using professional panels internally and externally for design, content flow, attention span, portability between devices, shareability taking note of consumer reactions to the overall experience. After reviewing a potential design we solicit participants for feedback on the design and gather the data. Once collected, the data is used to develop performance metrics across a wide range of age, background, technical expertise and other demographics that pertain to users from all walks of life. This data collection then transforms into usable data for existing and future site design.</br></br><a href="#contact_us">Click <b>HERE</b> to speak with a consultant now.</a></p>

							<h3>Customer Detractors</h3>
							<p>One of the largest pitfalls to avoid in site design is in the message. Users do not like when they go to a website and find that after reading it, there is no clear message of what the content is trying to convey. At <b>LawDesign</b>, we employ a team of content creators who are tasked with researching content and providing original content for your site. All content is professionally written by our staff and includes a format which grabs user attention and conveys the message without unnecessary length. The content will be easy to navigate, clean, and relevant to your business.</p>
							<p>Many sites fail to provide the simplest contact information. <b>WebDesign</b> will create a contact platform that will allow users to message your business directly, provide important phone numbers and addresses, and social media information where the prospective clients may contact you. Staying connected with your customers is a vital aspect of the design process.</p>
							<p>UI design will concentrate on other factors that annoy the customer into leaving your site. <b>LawDesign</b> will not use any annoyances that would detract from the customer and user experience such as animated ads, pop-ups, automatic audio/video sources, and intrusive chat or offers. Our design team will enlist the aid of our professional photographers who will spend time at your business creating professional photographs of the business, products, employees and capture the vision of your firm.</br></br><a href="#contact_us">Click <b>HERE</b> to speak with a consultant now.</a></p>
